## *.ts files

### Description
This classes handle the link between business logic (@source modules) and routes (endpoints)

### Code Guidelines

- Each class must be associated with a model or group of endpoints *e.g toys, pets*
- Each class **can only implement the following methods**
```
getList();
getDetails();
save();
update();
delete();
```
>In case of need extra funcions use /extensions classes


### Quality checklist
- [ ] Only imports models & sources modules.
- [ ] Only uses the CRUD methods indicated.
- [ ] Only uses responses.ts class for handle data sending.
